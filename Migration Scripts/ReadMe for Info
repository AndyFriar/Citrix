Export Scripts: (Source Farm)

    ExportAppFolderStructure.ps1
        - Exports application folder structure from an existing farm to XML
    ExportTags.ps1
        - Exports all defined tags from an existing farm to XML
    ExportAppGroups.ps1
        - Exports all AppGroups from an existing farm to XML 
    ExportApplications.ps1
        - Exports all applications from an existing Delivery AppGroups to XML
        - Can define a Delivery Group, if not defined, Script will Export each Delivery Group to a unique XML

        - Exports all applications from all AppGroups to XML

Import Scripts: (Destination Farm or Cloud Site)

    ImportAppFolderStructure.ps1
        - Imports application folder structure from an exported XML configuration
        - Script handles parent pathing
        - If folder already exists in the structure, Script ignores and moves on
        - If folder does not exist, Script creates folder within the existing structure
        - Cloud Switch will prompt for Cloud Credentials. Ensure appropriate Cloud PS Modules available
    ImportTags.ps1
        - Imports all defined tags from an exported XML configuration
        - If Tag already exists, Script ignores and moves on 
        - If Tag does not exist, Script creates the Tag
        - Cloud Switch will prompt for Cloud Credentials. Ensure appropriate Cloud PS Modules available
    ImportAppGroups.ps1
        - Imports all defined AppGroups from an exported XML configuration
        - If AppGroups already exists, Script ignores and moves on
        - if AppGroup does not exist, Script creates the AppGroup 
        - If AppGroups have Tags defined, Script checks for existance of Tags: 
            - If not found: Script attempts to create
            - If found: Script attempts to use
        - If AppGroups have RestrictToTag configurations defined, Script checks for existance of Tag, if not found attempts to create, if found, attempts to assign
        - If Appgroups have visibility limitations defined, Script will configured matching visibility settings
        - If AppGroups have users defined, Script applies all user assignments
        - Cloud Switch will prompt for Cloud Credentials. Ensure appropriate Cloud PS Modules available
    ImportApplications.ps1
        - Imports all defined applications from an exported XML configuration
        - Can define a Delivery Group for Import, if not defined, Script will list all Delivery Groups and require a selection
        - If applications have Tags defined, Script checks for existance of Tags: 
            - If not found: Script attempts to create 
            - if found: Scripts attempts to use
        - Script will import Icon files and apply (Note, applications with inbuilt icons used will fail and utilise default)
        - If applications have users defined, Script applies all user assignments
        - Cloud Switch will prompt for Cloud Credentials. Ensure appropriate Cloud PS Modules available
    ImportApplicationsFromAppGroups.ps1
        - Imports all defined applications from an exported XML configuration
        - If AppGroup does not exist, Script ignores application creation
        - If multiple AppGroups are defined:
            - Script will leverage the last AppGroup in the Array for initial creation
            - Script loops through all AppGroups post creation to ensure all AppGroup memberships are mirrored
        - If applications have Tags defined, Script checks for existance of Tags: 
            - If not found: Script attempts to create
            - If found: Script attempts to assign
        - Script will import Icon files and apply (Note, applications with inbuilt icons used will fail and utilise default)
        - If applications have users defined, Script applies all user assignments
        - Cloud Switch will prompt for Cloud Credentials. Ensure appropriate Cloud PS Modules available

Misc Migration Scenarios:

    MigrateDedicatedMachines.ps1
        - Imports a list of Dedicated/Persistent Virtual Machines from an existing Catalog
        - Script Prompts for:
            - New Hypervisor Connection (lists all connections in destination farm)
            - New Catalog (lists all Catalogs in destination farm)
            - New Delivery Group (lists all Delivery Groups in destination farm)
        - Optionally, a published Name can be defined to avoid Delivery Group Display Name being used
        - Script will mirror user assignments
        - If machine already exists, Script will ignore and move on
        - Tested with Cloud Migrations
